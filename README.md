# Problem Statement
This application is a 5 question Vanilla JavaScript quiz. Using a single stylesheet, single html page, and two JavaScript files a 5 question timed quiz that repeats as much as the user wants is created. This app focuses on creating a dynamically updating html page that seamlessly allows user interaction to take a quiz with immediate feedback following each question. This app also incorporates a timed aspect to taking the quiz, moving the user along if they are not quick enough with their answers. At the conclusion of the quiz, the user is prompted with their score and asked if they want to try again, or not. This ensures that there isnâ€™t any need to reload the page in order to regain functionality on the users half.

# Directory Structure
- In the root of our project directory, we have one html file. Our index.html
- This index.html calls our stylesheet and JavaScript Files. It is essentially where the application is running as everything gets called here and brought together 
- questions.Js simply holds an array with our questions. If someone wanted to change a question, or all of the questions, they would just have to go into this file and update the array to their liking
